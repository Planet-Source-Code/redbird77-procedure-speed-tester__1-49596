### Description

* 2003-11-04 UPDATE * Fixed "subscript out of range" bug. Thanks R. Gilchrist. Added HTML to clipboard. Thanks R.Rayment.

-- This is a quickly built utility app that can run procedures a user-specified amount of times

and graphically (and via HTML) display the speed results.

--This app is not meant to super accurate down to the nanosecond. It is just meant to give a rough idea on the speed of various procedures and more importantly the relative fastness or slowness of one procedure compared to another.
